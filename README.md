# Example-Unity-VR-Project
First Attempt at a Virtual Reality Unity Scene for COMP 253 - Virtual Reality class at University of the Pacific

Project Requirements:

1. The display must be in stereo 3D (you can use either the passive stereo display screen or an Oculus Rift).

2. The user's head position must be tracked (i.e. if user's move their head the display should change appropriately).

3. It must be possible to select and manipulate at least three objects in the environment. How object selection and manipulation works is up to you (it might be easiest if you also track the user's hand, but you can do whatever is appropriate for your application).

4. It must be possible to navigate around and explore your virtual environment. How navigation works is up to you.

Included implementation was originally created with Unity 5.0, lacking integrated Oculus VR support. Updatedon 2/21/2016 to use official Unity 5.3 Oculus VR support.

Simple classroom scene whereby users can pick up and throw objects around the room. Objects are highlighted in green when able to be picked up using left mouse button, and when held can be thrown by pressing again.
All assets used were free and available on the Unity Asset Store.
